== Description ==

Allows you to minify your CSS and JS files for faster page loading for visitors. This plugin uses the PHP library [Minify](http://code.google.com/p/minify/) and relies on WordPress's enqueueing system rather than the output buffer (will not break your website in most cases). This plugin is very customizable and easy to use.

**Some Features**

* Uses the enqueueing system of WordPress which improves compatibility with other plugins and themes
* Allows you to customize all minify strings
* Offers various way to add a cache buster to your minify string
* Gives you total control over how this plugin minifies your scripts
* Supports script localization (`wp_localize_script()`)
* Supports RTL stylesheets
* Supports media-specific stylesheets (e.g. ‘screen’, ‘print’, etc.)
* Supports conditional stylesheets (e.g. `<!--[if lt IE 7]>`)
* Provides hooks for further customization
* WordPress Multi-site compatible (not tested with WPMU)
